# git-task

Dear Reviewer: I am not sure how to respond to this instruction, because I have the public repository "github.com/kbirson/git-task" which contains the hello-world program and a text file containing the repository URL in the main branch. Could you explain what I am missing? 

_"Unfortunately, Practical task 2 still has not been completed. The task required you to create a public repository called 'git-task', push the hello-world program to the repository and provide a link to the repository in a text file. Please can you complete this task as required."_
